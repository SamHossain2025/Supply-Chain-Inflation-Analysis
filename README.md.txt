# 📦 Supply Chain Inflation – World Bank Panel Data Analysis (Datathon 2025)

**A global analysis of producer price inflation using panel data, with variable optimization via VIF and correlation filtering, and model selection via Fixed and Random Effects modeling.**  
*Developed as part of Datathon 2025 by Sam & Zaheen.*

---

## 📌 Objective

This project investigates the key drivers of **Producer Price Inflation** across countries using a structured panel dataset sourced from the **World Bank**, **UNDP**, and other development indicators.  
We applied panel data regression techniques (FE/RE) and selected variables using statistical filters like VIF and correlation thresholds.

---

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ **Panel data regression** with country-year granularity
- ✅ **Multicollinearity reduction** using VIF & correlation matrix
- ✅ **Modeling with Fixed Effects and Random Effects**
- ✅ **Hausman Test** to determine the preferred model
- ✅ **Interactive visualizations** for data insight
- ✅ 📊 Final deliverables: PowerPoint presentation & written report

🧪 Model Insights
1. Multicollinearity handled via VIF (threshold = 10) and correlation > 0.9
2. Fixed and Random Effects models built on cleaned features
3. Hausman Test used to choose FE vs RE
4. Model 3 demonstrated the most robust results and interpretability
